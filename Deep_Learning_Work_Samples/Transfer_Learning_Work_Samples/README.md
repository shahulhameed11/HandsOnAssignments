I have used Transfer Learning to classify the food/non food images using VGG16 in Google Colab with the latest framewrok Tensorflow 2.0. Here I have also applied data augmentation to the food dataset to create additional samples. I have achieved training accuracy 98.7% and validation accuracy 97.9%
